### Your Task

Consider the scenario of the online reseller from the previous exercise. Try to create a more formal information model for the scenario description and document it using an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERM).

1.  Make yourself familiar with the notation of the ERM!

2.  Create a ERM that reflects the company\'s information requirements! Build upon the result of the previous exercise!

## Hints

You can use tools such as Miro, PowerPoint or Google Slides to build an ERM in a digital format. Drawing it on a piece of paper and scanning it later is another viable option.

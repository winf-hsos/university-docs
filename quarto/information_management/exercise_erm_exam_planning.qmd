### Your Task

You are all familiar with the examinations at the end of the semester. As you might have guessed, before the examinations can take place, a lot of planning and organization must have happened in the background. Let's assist our student office and create an information model of their problem domain! As *one example*, think about all the rooms that need to be booked.
